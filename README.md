This is my NeoVim settings

Requirements:
  + Python
  + NodeJS
  + Internet

Installing :
  + Install plug-vim : https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug
  + Copy and paste nvim and nvim-data folder at local . For me it's is ~/AppData/Local/
  + edit file init.vim with NeoVim run command : PlugI   to install all the plug-in
  + Enjoy

More beautiful if you have Windows Terminal or Linux terminal and use its background
